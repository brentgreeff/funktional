ShouldB
=======

An alternative Rails testing framework which extends
Test::Unit with some useful helper methods covering common scenarios.
Gives useful error messages.

In my opinion it has a slightly clearer syntax which suits the
Test::Unit style better than current solutions (IMHO).

Why?
Hash syntax is pretty.

Its a work in progress and only covers common scenarios,
being able to write your own assertions would be useful...

Example
=======

get :new
should :render => 'something/new'

# 

get :new
should :assign_new => Something

# 

get :edit, :id => something.id
assigned(Something).should_be something

# 

get :new
should :redirect_to => '/login'

# 

post :create, :something => attrib

should :send_email => {
  :from => 'me@example.com',
  :to => 'you@example.com',
  :containing => "something awesome"
}

# 

should :create => Something do
  post :create, :something => attrib
end

# 

should :delete => Something do
  put :destroy, :id => something.id
end

# 

should_not :delete => Something do
  put :destroy, :id => something.id
end

# 

should_not :create => Something do
  post :create, :something => attrib
end
